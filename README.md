### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My experience in programming started in the 12th grade when I decided this is the field I want to pursue, and currently I am particularly passionate about: * Communication Protocols

* CCNA 

* Game Developing/Graphics following a project implementation of a game similar to Duck Hunt.


â€¢ I have knowledge in Object-Oriented Programming (Java), Data Structures, Assembly Languages, Procedural Programming (Racket, Haskell), Parallel and Distributed Algorithms (basic knowledge).


â€¢ The languages studied so far are: [C, C++, Java] - medium level, [Matlab, Racket, Haskell, Prolog, Verilog] - basic knowledge-medium.
